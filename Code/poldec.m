function [U, H] = poldec(A)
%POLDEC   Polar decomposition.
%         [U, H] = POLDEC(A) computes a matrix U of the same dimension
%         as A, and a Hermitian positive semi-definite matrix H,
%         such that A = U*H.
%         U has orthonormal columns if m>=n, and orthonormal rows if m<=n.
%         U and H are computed via an SVD of A.
%         U is a nearest unitary matrix to A in both the 2-norm and the
%         Frobenius norm.
