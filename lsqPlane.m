    % in a least-square sense. The hyperplane is returned as a Point and Normal row 
    % vectors.

    % Iteratively discards samples whose distance from the found plane exceeds th .
    %
    % [... , samplesused] = lsqPlane(...)
    % Returns a vector of indices of the samples that weren't discarded in the process.
